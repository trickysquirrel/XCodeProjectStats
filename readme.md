## About

We all know that we should all be writing simpler code, but what really makes code complicated and is there any real need to address it.  So it first makes sense to prove there is a problem or at least recognise when we should be thinking about it.  For this Iâ€™ve created a script that will extract annonoumous git and file stats from Xcode projects, such as age of file, number of commits, CCN value etc.  
If you are kind enough to send me the stats I can use them in a series of blog posts about code complexity on when we should address the issue and how we can go out it.

## Requirements

- Mac
- Lizard
- Xcode git repo project

## Installation

1. First install Lizzard, you can find it here https://github.com/terryyin/lizard.  I just downloaded the repo and placed it into my Downloads folder.
2. Download the gitStats.sh script in this repo and place it into the folder that contains the Xcode git repo you want to inspect, usually the root of your project.
3. Amend the script method 'lizardStatsForFile' to point to the location of lizard.py, so if you downloaded it to Users/bob/Downloads/ the method should look something like the following... (please excuse my terrible bash scripting skills)

```
function lizardStatsForFile {
    output="$(python /Users/bob/Downloads/lizard-master/lizard.py "$1")"
    lastline="${output##*$'\n'}"
    IFS=':'; arrIN=($lastline); unset IFS;
    echo $arrIN
}
```

4. Run the script and wait a little while (the more files there are the longer this takes)

```
bash gitStats.sh "/location/of/project/folders" > output.txt
```

Note: If you want to see which file the stats relate to amend the following line

from
```
echo "${ageOfFileInDays} ${numberOfCommits} ${numberOfAuthors} ${lizardStats} $2"
```
to
```
echo "${ageOfFileInDays} ${numberOfCommits} ${numberOfAuthors} ${lizardStats} $2 $file"
```


## Script Output:

### Information per repo

Number of commits
Number of contributors

### Information per file
```
num days old
num of commits 
num of authors
lizzard stats - nLines, nLoc, Avg.NLOC, AvgCCN, Avg.token, Fun Cnt, Warning Cnt, Fun Rt, nLoc RT
Is test file
```
### Example

```
number of total commits for repo 34683
number of contributors for repo 79
Count: 470
age days, nCommits, nAuthors, nLines nloc, Avg.NLOC , AvgCCN,  Avg.token, Fun Cnt, Warning cnt, Fun Rt, nloc Rt, Test(Yes=1)

## Sharing

The more we share the more we learn.  

I'd love to get access to your project stats and compare them to others, but I'll only make it annonoumously public on your request, e.g it will be held in this repo under a folder called ProjectA etc.

Please see below the instruction for sharing the data and if you could also include the following questions and answers that would be amazing.


## Emailing

```
